## Additional Notes

### Project Philosophy
This is a solo developer pet project built in free time with help from LLMs
and other tools for rapid prototyping and learning game development. The goal
was to create something functional for online team building during COVID/war isolation.

### What This Means
- This is a learning project by someone with zero game development experience
- Code quality reflects "newbie issues" and rapid prototyping
- It's far from complete but 100% playable with a Game Master
- Built for fun, not for enterprise use

### Usage Rights
This license allows anyone to:
- Play the game freely
- Host their own instances
- Fork and experiment with the code
- Learn from the implementation
- Use components in other projects

### No Warranty
This software is provided "as is" without warranty. As a solo learning project:
- Expect bugs and rough edges
- No guarantee of continuous development
- May have architectural issues due to learning curve
- Built primarily for personal use case

### Questions?
For any questions:
- Join Discord: https://discord.gg/32dwT8EP
- Check the actual game: https://dx.awsome.live/

# Dimension-X Game

## PROJECT DISCLAIMER

**This is a pet project developed in free time with help of LLMs and other tools to achieve fast results and test ideas.**

The goals are simple:
- **Fun for developers** (me learning game development)
- **Fun for people who play**
- **Fun for those who want to make fun**

I had **zero experience in game development** and struggled with all the newbie issues you can imagine, but eventually got something that works.

## What This Is

A turn-based online game inspired by D&D. Built because COVID isolation and the war in Ukraine made our regular lamp meetups impossible, so I decided to build something so our team could have team building online.

**[Play the game](https://dx.awsome.live/)** | **[Discord](https://discord.gg/vC3TvVzK)** | **[Explore Lore](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-VIcO0L3rg-dimension-x-game-architect)**

### The Story

First I was inspired by D&D games where people have fun, drink beer/coffee and relax having deep journeys. When COVID appeared and we had isolation, and now unfortunately we have WAR in Ukraine and we can't just have these lamp meetups as before, so I decided to build something so that our team could have team building online.

Having 0 experience in game development, I struggled with all newbie issues that we can have, but finally got to play our first game. The campaign was about "ALE of Eternity" — some participants liked it, some not, but I got feedback and continued to improve the game.

As a result, not all mechanics are based on game master decisions and players have some interaction. We now have a turn-based game with map, skills, NPCs, fight system, etc.

**It's far away from completed and I don't have dedicated time to work on it, but with help of a Game Master it's 100% playable and works for the target - have fun!**

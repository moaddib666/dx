# Contributing to Dimension-X

Thanks for your interest in this project!

## What This Project Actually Is

This is a **solo developer pet project** built in free time with help from LLMs and other tools for rapid prototyping. I had zero game development experience when I started and struggled with all the typical newbie issues.

The goal was simple: build something so my team could have online team building during COVID/war isolation instead of our usual in-person D&D meetups.

**Current status:** Far from complete, but 100% playable with a Game Master and achieves the goal - having fun!

## How You Can Help

Since this is a solo learning project, I'm not expecting big contributions, but if you're interested:

### Found Issues?
- Report bugs you encounter
- Suggest improvements based on actual gameplay
- Share ideas on [Discord](https://discord.gg/vC3TvVzK)

### Want to Code?
- Feel free to fork and experiment
- Share interesting improvements
- Keep in mind this is a learning project with probably lots of "beginner mistakes"

### Want to Play?
- Try the game at https://dx.awsome.live/
- Give feedback about what works/doesn't work
- Join campaigns if available

### Interested in Lore?
- Check out the [Game Architect](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-VIcO0L3rg-dimension-x-game-architect)
- Create your own Claude workspace with the merged docs
- Expand the world if you're into that

## Technical Setup

- Frontend: Vue.js with auto-generated client
- Backend: Django with admin interface
- Check individual component READMEs for details

## Code Style

There probably isn't a consistent style since I was learning as I went. If you contribute code:
- Try to match what's already there
- Don't stress about perfection
- Comment confusing parts

## Project Philosophy

This isn't a personal project with no standards. It's about:
- Learning new things
- Having fun 
- Testing ideas quickly
- Getting something that works, not something perfect

For 1 turn character can spend his action points to chain actions, almount of action points depends on speed attribure * dimention time enhansmants
The speed also influance the order of global actions in case you and your opponent cust action that cost same almount of action ponts first would been applied that whos speed skill is bigger.
Actions may impact the caller or the target depends of the selector.
You could only perform an action on the creature that in your view and that on the same dimantion or the dimantion above (2->1)
The action of changing dimantion take all youe action ponts.
You can also skip the turn.
Some action may consume energy (flow) you can refill it only on 1 dimention or by using artifacts, battaries.

Dimension-X: Dimensions and Their Interactions

The world of Dimension-X has 10 dimensions, each with unique characteristics and interactions.

Common For All Dimensions

- Health Points: If you lose all health points, you are no longer a fighter. You need medical aid and will be transferred to a safe place, dropping to the 1st dimension and becoming disabled until the event finishes.
- Energy: If you lose all your energy, you will drop to the 1st dimension. You need to spend time accumulating energy before you can refill it and return to the event, delve into dimensions, or perform energy-related actions.

1st Dimension

Description: The real world where modern life exists. People build cities and communicate. It is full of energy, and any creature can live here. The time flow is regular, with Earth-like flora and fauna across various biomes. Energy is not spent on standard actions and is accumulated over time. Interaction is limited to the current dimension, with the possibility to dive into the 2nd dimension without energy cost.

2nd Dimension

Description: A mirror of the real world but darker, with all colors gray except for energy flow, artifacts, and blood. The time flow is faster, allowing more actions in the same time. There are no creatures, but it mirrors the biomes and fauna of the 1st dimension. Energy is spent on moves and standard actions and is also spent over time. Interaction is possible with the current dimension and the 1st dimension. Diving into the 3rd dimension costs energy, while exiting to the 1st dimension does not.

TimeFormula: {basicActionTime} * 1.5
EnergyFormula: {currentEnergyStats} - 10 * {TimeFormula}
PossibleAffectOnDimensions: {current}, 1
Transitions:
  - dimension: 1
    cost: 0
  - dimension: 3
    cost: 10

3rd Dimension

Description: A faded shadow of the 2nd dimension with all colors gray, featuring a fog or black sandstorm. It is a dangerous place where shadows appear and disappear. Lifeless, with non-significant differences from the 1st and 2nd dimensions. Structures like walls and rivers might not exist or behave differently. Energy is spent on moves and standard actions, and is also spent over time. Interaction is possible with the current dimension and the 2nd dimension. Diving into the 4th dimension costs a huge amount of energy, while exiting to the 2nd dimension does not.

TimeFormula: {basicActionTime} * 2
EnergyFormula: {currentEnergyStats} - 20 * {TimeFormula}
PossibleAffectOnDimensions: {current}, 2
Transitions:
  - dimension: 2
    cost: 0
  - dimension: 4
    cost: 100

4th Dimension

Description: A fairly dead zone with strong storms that obscure vision. The time flow is faster, allowing more actions in the same time. There are no creatures, and significant differences exist but cannot be easily spotted. Hazards like falling from cliffs or being hit by stones are common. Occasionally, sharp shadows of humanoid creatures with blue glowing eyes are seen. Energy is spent on moves and standard actions, and is also spent over time. Interaction is possible with the current dimension and the 3rd dimension. Diving into the 5th dimension costs an enormous amount of energy, which no one can handle currently, while exiting to the 3rd dimension does not.

TimeFormula: {basicActionTime} * 2.5
EnergyFormula: {currentEnergyStats} - 25 * {TimeFormula}
PossibleAffectOnDimensions: {current}, 3
Transitions:
  - dimension: 3
    cost: 0
  - dimension: 5
    cost: 1000

5th to 10th Dimensions

Description: These dimensions are largely unknown. Everyone who has tried to pass the barrier has been dropped back to the 1st dimension without energy.

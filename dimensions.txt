Only possible interruct with current dimention
It's possible to dive into second dimention don't spend energy on transition

```json
{
  "TimeFormula": "{basicActionTime} * 1",
  "EnergyFormula": "{currentEnergyStats} + 10 * {TimeFormula}",
  "PossibleAffectOnDimentions": "{current}",
  "Transitions": [{
    "dimention": 2,
    "cost": 0
  }]
}
```

# 2d Dimention

## Description:
The mirror of real world but some dark one, all collors are gray except energy flow, artifacts and blood,

Energy spent on moves and standart actions, more over it's spend in time
Possible interruct with current dimention and dimention below - 1st one.
It's possible to dive into the third dimention with energy spend.
Or exit on the first one don't spend energy on transition

```json
{
  "TimeFormula": "{basicActionTime} * 1.5",
  "EnergyFormula": "{currentEnergyStats} - 10 * {TimeFormula}",
  "PossibleAffectOnDimentions": [{current}, 1],
  "Transitions": [{
    "dimention": 1,
    "cost": 0
  },{
    "dimention": 3,
    "cost": 10
  }]
}
```

# 3d Dimention

## Description:
The fade shadow of the dimention 2 all collors are gray except energy flow, artifacts and blood, has kind of fog or sandstorm of black sand,

It's possible to dive into the forth dimention with huge energy spend.
Or exit on the second one don't spend energy on transition

```json
{
  "TimeFormula": "{basicActionTime} * 2",
  "EnergyFormula": "{currentEnergyStats} - 20 * {TimeFormula}",
  "PossibleAffectOnDimentions": [{current}, 2],
  "Transitions": [{
    "dimention": 2,
    "cost": 0
  },{
    "dimention": 4,
    "cost": 100
  }]
}
```

# 4d Dimention

Or exit on the third one don't spend energy on transition


```json
{

  "EnergyFormula": "{currentEnergyStats} - 25 * {TimeFormula}",
  "PossibleAffectOnDimentions": [{current}, 3],
  "Transitions": [{
    "dimention": 3,
    "cost": 0
